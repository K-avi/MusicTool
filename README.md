MusicTool is a simple terminal application in C I'm doing on my spare time to learn the language. 

it's my first project and a learning project and I'm not claiming it's perfect.
MusicTool should work on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

This version of MusicTool is currently far from finished. However, the scale system is redesigned and now works properly. As far as I know, it doesn't leak memory or crash. If it does, please contact me. 

The parsing from command line is a bit buggy. Once I am done with the chord parsing/generating n so on I will fix it and then I might move on to parsing files n make this a proper interpreter.
