MusicTool is a simple terminal application in C I'm doing on my spare time to learn the language. 

it's my first project and a learning project and I'm not claiming it's perfect.
MusicTool should work on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

This version of MusicTool is currently far from finished. However, the scale system is redesigned and now works properly. As far as I know, it doesn't leak memory or crash. If it does, please contact me. 

The next thing I will be working on is the scale generation system. I will then move on to saving data on formated text files and then if I'm brave enough and have time I will try to implement MIDI generation.
