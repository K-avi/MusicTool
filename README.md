MusicTool is a simple terminal application in C I'm doing on my spare time to learn C. 

it's my first project and a learning project and I'm not claiming it's particularly well done. 

MusicTool is distributed under the GNU public license and should work on both Linux and Windows system

This version of MusicTool is not even close from being finished; it's not clean, a lot of features are missing; it's general design is bad; it has undefined behavior and leaks memory. 

I upload it because I will redesign the scale system, the basic representation of scale going from arrays to ushort.

However, the app still kinda works and can be run from a terminal.
