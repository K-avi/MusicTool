                MusicTool is a simple command line and file interpreter coded in C.
                Like it's name suggests it's main purpose is to be a tool for Music operations such as scale generation,
                triad prog generations and analyzing various properties of musical sets and objects.

                <p class="text-left">
                    to represented musical scales, MusicTool uses sets of numbers%12. 
                    Each number present in the set represents a note present in the scale, with the number indicating how many semitones separate the fundamental note of the scale from the note.
                    for example , the major scale would be represented as { 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 }. 
                    If we take C as the fundamental note of the major scale, it would be C D E F G A B
                
                    How are scales encoded ? 
                    Scales are stored on 11 bits as unsigned short integers. It is assumed that every scale contains a fundamental note, 
                    each other note present in the scale is stored as a bit set to 1. If the first bit of the u_short is set it means that the scale 
                    contains a minor second, if the second is set a major second, ...
                    
                    This representation is different from the standart pitch class set representation , if you want to learn more on

                    harmonised scale are a list of abstract scale. And are stored as such. 
                    I assumed that it was more to store the whole harmonised scale once it is generated 
                    rather than storing it as it's fundamental mode and generating it each time it is called for an operation. 
                    Harmonised scale being a list of u_shorts of length between 2 and 11 they don't take much space. I might change this implementation 
                    if I realise it's more interresting to store them as their fundamental mode and generate them if need be (to print them for example)

                    A triad prog is a list of abstract triads using the degree notation of chords. An abstract triad consists on the root degree of the
                    triad relative to a tonic chord and the type of the triad. 
                    Due to it being easier to store , the triads are noted as such : 
                   <br/>major triad: [DEGREE]
                   <br/>minor triad: [DEGREE]m
                   <br/>diminished triad: [DEGREE]-

                    <br/>I didn't use ° to represent the diminished chord bc it's an UTF-8 character and I didn't feel like working with them.
                    
                    triad progs are noted between brackets. 
                    For example: the triad prog [ IVm, V, Im] represents the triad progression from a minor triad located at the fourth degree of a scale
                    to a  major one located at the fifth to another major one located on the tonic. 
                    if we take the C harmonic minor scale, the progression [ IVm , V, I]  would be Fm, G, Cm

                    <br/>sus4 chords: [DEGREE]sus4 add i,j,..,n

                    <br/>The "add" is necessary only if the chord has one or more extensions. The extensions are separated by ",". 
                    if you wish to parse a triad (chord without extensions) you can simply write the chord without add.
                   <br/>nb: I didn't use ° to represent the diminished chord bc it's an UTF-8 character and I didn't feel like working with them.
                    
                    chord progs are noted between brackets. 
                    <br/>For example: the chord prog [ IIm add 7 ; V add b7 ; Iadd7] represents the chord progression from a IVmaj7 chord located at the fourth degree of a scale
                    to a  dominant 7 chord located at the fifth to another major 7 one located on the tonic. 
                    if we take the C harmonic major scale, the progression would be Dm7, G7, Cmaj7. 

                    <br/><br/>Specifity of extension syntax: 

                    <br/>-the notation of chords that omits the "add" is not supported. a Imaj7 chord HAS to be passed as "Iadd 7"
                    <br/>-similarly, the extensions are written as degrees. A IV add 6,9 chord HAS to be written IVadd 6,2 (or IVadd2,6 the order doesn't matter)
                    <br/>-the 7 always stands for major 7 degree and b7 for a minor 7th. Thus the chord Vadd7 is Vmaj7 and not V7. 
                          a V7 chord is written Vaddb7.
                          the same thing applies for every other extension.

                    Dodecaphonic series (or tone rows) are an orderer set of every 12-tet note. They are commonly used in serial and 
                    dodecaphonic music. If you want to learn more about serialism and dodecaphonic series please check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique#Tone_row" target="blank">wikipedia article on serialism</a>
                    or <a href="https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/Serialism.html">Robert Hutchinson's course on serialism</a>
                    In music tool series are stored as 64 bits integer. However only the first 48 bits are relevants, the 16 remaining are used as an error flag. 
                    Each number in the serie is stored on 4 bits; the first number of the serie is stored from the LSB to bit 3 ,the second from bit 4 to 7 and so on.
                    The MusicTool syntax for series is the same as the scale one, except a serie MUST be of length 12 (contain every note). 
                    For example: { 11 4 5 2 3 6 7 9 8 1 0} is a valid serie.
                    MusicTool implements the common serie operations such as inversion, retrograde, prime and 12 tone matrix calculation

                        The scale keyword is used to pass commands on scale. The commands currently available are : 
                        <br/><br/>-rand : rand generates random scale; 
                                it can be passed with or without argument, if passed with an integer argument the scale  
                                generated will be the length of the argument, otherwise the length of the scale and 
                                the scale itself will be random. rand also makes the generated scale 
                                the current temporary saved scale
                        <br/><br/>-save : save is used to save scales , if passed with a scale argument the scale passed will
                                be saved;
                                if passed without argument, the interpreter will check if there is currently a temporary
                                scale saved and save it if it's the case. 
                        <br/><br/>-print : print can be passed with one integer argument or the env keuword. If passed with an integer it will print the scale stored at the 
                                index passed; If passed with env, it will print every scale currently saved
                        <br/><br/>-remove : remove has to be passed with one integer argument, it will remove the scale stored at
                                the index passed as argument if it exists and reindex the saved scales.
                        <br/><br/>-invert : can be passed without argument , with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument calculates the inverse of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the inverse of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.

                        <br/><br/>-comp : can be passed without argument , with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it calculates the complementary of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the complementary of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.


                        <br/><br/>-prime : can be passed without argument, with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it calculates the prime form of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the prime form of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.
                        
                        <br/><br/>-nearby : can be passed  without argument, with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it generates a nearby scale of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument it generates a nearby scale of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.

                        MusicTool commands can be written on files. A file that contains MusicTool commands must begin by 
                        "MusicTool:commands". The commands available and their syntax are the same than the command line ones.

                        MusicTool environment can be written on files from command line with the command "write env" or by hand. An environment file must begin by "MusicTool:environment". to write an environment, you must begin by the keyword "env" followed by the type of the objects. The beginning and the end of the
                        environment are marked by parenthesis 
                        For example, to write a scale environment you must write "env scale" then open a parenthesis then 
                        write the scales you want to load as MusicTool scale. 
                        writing down harmonised scales works the same as scales except the environment must begin by 
                        env harmo" 
                        writing down a triad prog env also works the same except the env must begin by "env triad".
                        dodecaphonic series environment works similarly, but the environment must begin with 
                        "env dodec".
                        chord prog environment works similarly, but the environment must begin with 
                        "env prog".
                        Multiple environments can be written in a single environment file.

                            Shell MusicTool (for short smtool) is a program that tries to emulate the syntax of a shell command 
                            to do MusicTool operations.
                            The goal of smtool in the long run is to maximize it's compatibility with shell scripts and make it a practical way 
                            of testing MusicTool functions or doing short operations.

                            smtool implements all the commands that can be parsed from music tool except the "read env" and "write env" functions
                            Instead of launching an interpreter an smtool command is called from command line and takes two arguments; 
                            the first one corresponding to a MusicTool keyword (scale, harmo , triad,...) preceeded by a single "-"
                            the second argument is a MusicTool command available with the keyword. 
                            To parse the command correctly, it has to be contained between double quotes. 

                            Example: the MusicTool command 'scale rand 7' would be 'smtool -scale "rand 7" ' if called from smtool. 
                            The syntax for most of the MusicTool command is the same for smtool ones; except the "read command" function 
                            which is simplified to : 'smtool -read "filename.txt" '

                            NB: the save family of command aren't disabled in smtool; however they are useless as each smtool command takes place
                            in a new environment.
