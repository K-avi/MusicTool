                MusicTool is a simple command line and file interpreter coded in C.
                Like it's name suggests it's main purpose is to be a tool for Music operations such as scale generation,
                chord prog generations and analyzing various properties of musical sets and objects.

                <p class="text-left">
                    to represented musical scales, MusicTool uses sets of numbers%12. 
                    Each number present in the set represents a note present in the scale, with the number indicating how many semitones separate the fundamental note of the scale from the note.
                    for example , the major scale would be represented as { 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 }. 
                    If we take C as the fundamental note of the major scale, it would be C D E F G A B
                
                    How are scales encoded ? 
                    Scales are stored on 11 bits as unsigned short integers. It is assumed that every scale contains a fundamental note, 
                    each other note present in the scale is stored as a bit set to 1. If the first bit of the u_short is set it means that the scale 
                    contains a minor second, if the second is set a major second, ...
                    
                    This representation is different from the standart pitch class set representation , if you want to learn more on

                    harmonised scale are a list of abstract scale. And are stored as such. 
                    I assumed that it was more to store the whole harmonised scale once it is generated 
                    rather than storing it as it's fundamental mode and generating it each time it is called for an operation. 
                    Harmonised scale being a list of u_shorts of length between 2 and 11 they don't take much space. I might change this implementation 
                    if I realise it's more interresting to store them as their fundamental mode and generate them if need be (to print them for example)

                    A chprog is a list of abstract triads using the degree notation of chords. An abstract triad consists on the root degree of the
                    triad relative to a tonic chord and the type of the triad. 
                    Due to it being easier to store , the triads are noted as such : 
                    major triad: [DEGREE]
                    minor triad: [DEGREE]m
                    diminished triad: [DEGREE]-
                    augmented triad: [DEGREE]+ 
                    I didn't use Â° to represent the diminished chord bc it's an UTF-8 character and I didn't feel like working with them.
                    
                    chprogs are noted between brackets. 
                    For example: the chprog [ IVm, V, Im] represents the chord progression from a minor triad located at the fourth degree of a scale
                    to a  major one located at the fifth to another major one located on the tonic. 
                    if we take the C harmonic minor scale, the progression [ IVm , V, I]  would be Fm, G, Cm

                                Ith mode of the Jth harmonised scale as a scale if it exists and do nothing otherwise.  
                        <br/>-scale : must be passed with one scale argument, will generate the harmonised scale of the scale

                        <br/>-saved scale : must be passed with one integer argument, harmonises the saved scale stored at the
                                    index passed if it exists and generates it's harmonised scale. The harmonised scale
                                    generated is saved as the temporary saved harmonised scale  
                        <br/>-print : print has to be passed with one integer argument , it will print the harmonised scale 
                                stored at the index passed if it exists.
                        <br/>-remove : remove has to be passed with one integer argument, it will remove the harmonised scale 
                                stored at the index passed as argument if it exists and reindex the saved harmonised
                                scales.

                        "MusicTool:commands". The commands available and their syntax are the same than the command line ones.

                        MusicTool environment can be written on files from command line with the command "write env" or by hand. An environment file must begin by "MusicTool:environment". to write an environment, you must begin by the keyword "env" followed by the type of the objects. The beginning and the end of the
                        environment are marked by parenthesis 
                        For example, to write a scale environment you must write "env scale" then open a parenthesis then 
                        write the scales you want to load as MusicTool scale. 
                        writing down harmonised scales works the same as scales except the environment must begin by 
                        env harmo" 
                        finally writing down a chprog env works the same except the env must begin by "env chprog".
                        Multiple environments can be written in a single environment file.
