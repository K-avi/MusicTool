                MusicTool is a simple command line and file interpreter coded in C.
                Like it's name suggests it's main purpose is to be a tool for Music operations such as scale generation,
                chord prog generations and analyzing various properties of musical sets and objects.

                <p class="text-left">
                    to represented musical scales, MusicTool uses sets of numbers%12. 
                    Each number present in the set represents a note present in the scale, with the number indicating how many semitones separate the fundamental note of the scale from the note.
                    for example , the major scale would be represented as { 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 }. 
                    If we take C as the fundamental note of the major scale, it would be C D E F G A B
                
                    How are scales encoded ? 
                    Scales are stored on 11 bits as unsigned short integers. It is assumed that every scale contains a fundamental note, 
                    each other note present in the scale is stored as a bit set to 1. If the first bit of the u_short is set it means that the scale 
                    contains a minor second, if the second is set a major second, ...
                    
                    This representation is different from the standart pitch class set representation , if you want to learn more on

                    If you need to learn about the notion of a mode in Music Theory please visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)" target="blank">wikipedia article on modes</a>
                    harmonised scale are a list of abstract scale. And are stored as such. 
                    I assumed that it was more to store the whole harmonised scale once it is generated 
                    rather than storing it as it's fundamental mode and generating it each time it is called for an operation. 
                    Harmonised scale being a list of u_shorts of length between 2 and 11 they don't take much space. I might change this implementation 
                    if I realise it's more interresting to store them as their fundamental mode and generate them if need be (to print them for example)

                <p class="text-left">
                    A chprog is a list of abstract triads using the degree notation of chords. An abstract triad consists on the root degree of the
                    triad relative to a tonic chord and the type of the triad. 
                    Due to it being easier to store , the triads are noted as such : 
                    major triad: [DEGREE]
                    minor triad: [DEGREE]m
                    diminished triad: [DEGREE]-
                    augmented triad: [DEGREE]+ 
                    I didn't use Â° to represent the diminished chord bc it's an UTF-8 character and I didn't feel like working with them.
                    
                    chprogs are noted between brackets. 
                    For example: the chprog [ IVm, V, Im] represents the chord progression from a minor triad located at the fourth degree of a scale
                    to a  major one located at the fifth to another major one located on the tonic. 
                    if we take the C harmonic minor scale, the progression [ IVm , V, I]  would be Fm, G, Cm

                        The scale keyword is used to pass commands on scale. The commands currently available are :

                                it can be passed with or without argument, if passed with an integer argument the scale  
                                generated will be the length of the argument, otherwise the length of the scale and 
                                the scale itself will be random. rand also makes the generated scale 
                                the current temporary saved scale
                        <br/><br/>-save : save is used to save scales , if passed with a scale argument the scale passed will
                                be saved;
                                if passed without argument, the interpreter will check if there is currently a temporary
                                scale saved and save it if it's the case. 
                        <br/><br/>-print : print can be passed with one integer argument or the env keuword. If passed with an integer it will print the scale stored at the 
                                index passed; If passed with env, it will print every scale currently saved
                        <br/><br/>-remove : remove has to be passed with one integer argument, it will remove the scale stored at
                                the index passed as argument if it exists and reindex the saved scales.
                        <br/><br/>-invert : can be passed without argument , with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument calculates the inverse of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the inverse of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.

                        <br/><br/>-comp : can be passed without argument , with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it calculates the complementary of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the complementary of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.


                        <br/><br/>-prime : can be passed without argument, with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it calculates the prime form of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument calculates the prime form of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.
                        
                        <br/><br/>-nearby : can be passed  without argument, with a scale argument or "saved n" with n being the index of a saved scale.
                                If passed with an argument it generates a nearby scale of the scale passed or saved at index n and saves it into tmp saved.
                                if passed without argument it generates a nearby scale of the temp saved scale and stores it in temp saved scale.

                        The harmo keyword is used to pass commands on harmonised scales. The commands currently available are: 
                        <br/><br/>-rand : rand generates a random harmonised sscale; 
                                it can be passed with or without argument, if passed with an integer argument the harmonised scale  
                                generated will be the length of the argument, otherwise the length of the harmonised scale and 
                                the harmonised scale itself will be random. rand also makes the generated harmonised scale 
                                the current temporary saved harmonised scale
                        <br/><br/>-save : save is used to save scales , if passed with a scale argument the scale passed will
                                be harmonised and saved as an harmonised scale;
                                if passed without argument, the interpreter will check if there is currently a temporary
                                harmonised scale saved and save it if it's the case. 
                        <br/><br/>-save as scale : save as scale must be passed with two integers argument J I, it will save the
                                Ith mode of the Jth harmonised scale as a scale if it exists and do nothing otherwise.  
                        <br/><br/>-scale : must be passed with one scale argument, will generate the harmonised scale of the scale
                                passed as arg. And make it the current temporary saved harmonised scale
                        <br/><br/>-saved scale : must be passed with one integer argument, harmonises the saved scale stored at the
                                    index passed if it exists and generates it's harmonised scale. The harmonised scale
                                    generated is saved as the temporary saved harmonised scale  
                        <br/><br/>-print : can be passed with one integer argument or with env, if passed with an integer will print the harmonised scale 
                                stored at the index passed if it exists. If passed with env, prints every harmonised scale currently stored
                        <br/><br/>-remove : remove has to be passed with one integer argument, it will remove the harmonised scale 
                                stored at the index passed as argument if it exists and reindex the saved harmonised
                                scales.

                                if passed without will save the temporary saved chprog if it exists.
                        <br/><br/>-print : passed with one integer argument or the env keyword prints the chprog stored at index n if it exists or all the chprogs currenlty saved if passed with env. 
                        <br/><br/>-remove : passed with one integer argument removes the chprog stored at index n if it exists 
                                  and reindexes the remaining saved progs.
                        <br/><br/>-toscale : can be passed with a chprog arg, "saved n" arg or w/o args. If passed with a chprog will generate the scale containing each note
                                    of the chprog passed and save it in tmp_scale. If passed with a "saved n" arg will retrieve the chprog saved at index n and generate the scale containing
                                    the notes of the prog n save it in tmp_scale; if passed without argument will generate the scale containing the notes of the prog in the tmp_chprog and

                        MusicTool environment can be written on files from command line with the command "write env" or by hand. An environment file must begin by "MusicTool:environment". to write an environment, you must begin by the keyword "env" followed by the type of the objects. The beginning and the end of the
                        environment are marked by parenthesis 
                        For example, to write a scale environment you must write "env scale" then open a parenthesis then 
                        write the scales you want to load as MusicTool scale. 
                        writing down harmonised scales works the same as scales except the environment must begin by 
                        env harmo" 
                        finally writing down a chprog env works the same except the env must begin by "env chprog".
                        Multiple environments can be written in a single environment file.
