                        <li>PITCH_CLASS_SET: </li> size: 2 bytes; relevant bits : lsb to 11. Represents a set of notes in a 1-HOT format. Presence of the note {0} is wether lsb is set presence of {1} is wether second bit set ,...

                        bit 13 is an error flag.

                    S_USERINFO is a structure containing a reference to one of each S_SAVED_... structure 
                    in MusicTool as well as the number of elements in each of these structures.
                    <br/>At start, MusicTool initialises an S_USERINFO structure to store elements saved 
                    during the session.
                    when a "save" function is called.

                    The prog book is a dynamic array used to stored BOOKENTRY elements. 
                    It is initialised with 30 slots when MusicTool is launched and can be edited 
                    by reading an environment containing an env book() section or by using 
                    the command "book add"
